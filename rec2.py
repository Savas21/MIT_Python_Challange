## Recitation 2 code

# What is the decrementing function?
# What does this loop do?

### Prints even numbers from 2 to 10
# a = 2
# while (a <= 10) :
#     a += 2
#     print (a)

# odd_number = 1
# while (odd_number <= 10):
#     odd_number += 2
#     print(odd_number)

#
##For loop
#

# for i in (2,4,6,8,10):
#     print(i)

### Kind of inconvenient

#
### RAnge Function
#

#first paratmeter is inclusive and second parameter is exclusive
# print (range(100))
# print (range(1,100))
# print(range(1,100,2))
# count down
# print(range(100,1,-1))
#how to check the built in functions 
# bracets are used for optional parameters
# help(range)

# for i in range(2,1001,2):
#     print(i)


#
#Tuple
#

tuple_of_numbers = (3.1432, 2, 1, -100)
tuple_of_strings = ("WHat", "is", "tupleps")
